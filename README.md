# REC

## What is REC?

Find yourself getting tired of the monotony of both your daily life and your music?

‘Rec’ is:

- simple
- an easy-to-use app
- built to make daily tasks more enjoyable
- helps you discover new music!

With the click of a button, receive a series of images based on your selection, and a whole array of music recommendations! While you sift through the crates, a popular song by a recommended artist will play to set the mood.

## Description

'Rec' requests information from two different server-side APIs, Unsplash and TheAudioMusicDB. We used JavaScript to make the app interactive and allow the user to retrieve relevant information in a speedy manner. To style Rec, we used Semantic UI and Owl.Carousel.js.

The application has six built-in categories, and a random option for when the user is feeling adventurous! Each category will return a slideshow of images, provide a suggestion of music and play a song, all to put the user in the right mood for the user’s activity of choice.
